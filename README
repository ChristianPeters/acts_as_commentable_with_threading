Acts As Commentable (now with comment threads (TM)!!!  -- kidding on the (TM))
===================

Allows for threaded comments to be added to multiple and different models.  Drop-in compatible for acts_as_commentable (however requiring a database schema change)

class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_commentable
end
 
* Add a comment to a model instance
 
model = Model.new
comment = Comment.new(:model => model, :body => "Your comment text here")
comment.save!
comment.move_to_child_of(the_desired_parent_comment)

# Following doesn't work/make sense to me. Leaving for historical sake -- Jack
# * Each comment reference commentable object
#
# model = Model.find(1)
# model.comment_threads.first.commentable == model
